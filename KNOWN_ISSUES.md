# Known issues

This file tracks suspected bugs and stale code in the ETL pipeline that have
been noticed but not yet fixed. The intent is to keep them visible until they
can be triaged into proper tickets.

## Suspected bugs

### `mw_sickle_cell_disease_history_of_hospitalization` is never populated

`jobs/pentaho/malawi/transforms/import-into-mw-sickle-cell-disease-history-of-hospitalization.ktr`
writes to the table `mw_pdc_history_of_hospitalization`, not the
`mw_sickle_cell_disease_history_of_hospitalization` table that its filename
implies.

- The table `mw_sickle_cell_disease_history_of_hospitalization` has a DDL file
  at `jobs/pentaho/malawi/schema/table/mw_sickle_cell_disease_history_of_hospitalization.sql`,
  but no transform writes to it — so it is created empty on every refresh.
- A side effect is that `mw_pdc_history_of_hospitalization` ends up with two
  writers (the legitimate `import-into-pdc-history-of-hospitalization.ktr`
  plus this misrouted sickle-cell transform).
- Introduced in commit `596a04f` (MLW-1616, "add sickle cell disease history
  of hospitalization table in the data warehouse"). The .sql was added
  correctly but the .ktr's TableOutput step points at the wrong destination.

The current refactor preserves this behavior unchanged so as not to mix a fix
with a structural refactor. Resolving it likely means redirecting the
TableOutput step in the .ktr to its matching table.

### `mw_lab_tests_recent_period.sql` adds an index to the wrong table

`jobs/pentaho/malawi/schema/table/mw_lab_tests_recent_period.sql` ends with:

```sql
alter table mw_lab_tests add index mw_lab_tests_recent_idx (patient_id);
```

i.e. it creates the `mw_lab_tests_recent_period` table but then alters the
unrelated `mw_lab_tests` table — and the index it adds (`patient_id`) is
already covered by `mw_lab_tests_patient_idx` from `mw_lab_tests.sql`, so it's
a misnamed duplicate. The `mw_lab_tests_recent_period` table itself is left
without any indexes.

Likely intent: the index should have been on
`mw_lab_tests_recent_period(patient_id)`. The current refactor preserves the
existing (buggy) behavior — the orphan index lives in the `mw_lab_tests`
index file.

### `mw_patient` was being loaded 6× in the legacy pipeline (now fixed)

In the legacy pipeline (master, pre-MLW-1813), every program-specific job —
`load-malawi-data-{ART,NCD,PDC,Nutrition,POC,users}.kjb` — had
`import-into-mw-patient.ktr` as its first step. Because the TableOutput step
in that transform has `<truncate>N</truncate>`, each invocation appended
rather than replaced, so `mw_patient` ended up with 6× the actual patient
count (e.g. 497,130 rows for ~82,855 unique patients).

The MLW-1813 refactor incidentally fixed this: the per-table refresh in
`jobs/malawi/refresh-mw-tables.yml` drops and creates `mw_patient` once and
runs `import-into-mw-patient.ktr` exactly once. Row counts now match the
underlying OpenMRS patient count.

If anyone backports per-table self-contained jobs to a different branch,
they need to make sure no transform is invoked more than once, or that
TableOutput truncates before loading.

## Latent inconsistencies

### `get_parent_health_facility` function is referenced but never created

`jobs/pentaho/malawi/schema/function/get_parent_health_facility.sql` exists
in the schema dir but is not in `jobs/create-reporting-utilities.yml`, so
the function is never created at runtime.

The procedure `create_changed_regimen_list`
(`jobs/pentaho/malawi/schema/procedure/create_changed_regimen_list.sql`)
calls `get_parent_health_facility(...)` in its body. MySQL resolves the
function lazily (at procedure-call time, not at procedure-create time), so
the procedure is created without error — but if anything ever invokes
`create_changed_regimen_list`, MySQL will raise "FUNCTION ... does not
exist".

Either:

- the function should be added to `jobs/create-reporting-utilities.yml`
  (if `create_changed_regimen_list` is in active use), or
- both the function file and the call site should be removed (if the
  feature is dead).

The right call depends on whether anything in the reporting layer actually
calls `create_changed_regimen_list`.
